# Classrooms
This is a webapp that displays schedules of classes given a building, room number and day. 
If there is no input in the room number, it shows the currently open rooms in the selected building.
Take a look [here](http://www.jkliu.ca/classrooms).

Built with JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Python.
